## NVD Official CPE Directory List

For PoC, we need to get the official CPE directory list from NVD. Please refer to the [NVD Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) website and download the `Official CPE Dictionary v2.3, zip format` file before running the PoC.

File name will be like `official-cpe-dictionary_v2.3.xml.zip`.
